# First, we need to tell SLURM some information about the job
#SBATCH --job-name=BERT

# Requesting 4 GB of memory - This is just a mall example,
# and this line allows the rest of the memory to be used
# by other jobs
#SBATCH --mem=4G

# Estimating a runtime of at most 10 minutes - Good estimates
# of runtime help the scheduler and may help your job get
# scheduled earlier, but will also kill your job if it exceeds
# the requested time
#SBATCH --time=00:10:00

# These 2 lines request a GPU
# If no GPU is needed, you can remove them
#SBATCH --partition=GPU

# Telling SLURM where to write output and error files
# %j gives job id
# %x gives job name
#SBATCH --output=%x-%j.out
#SBATCH --error=%x-%j.err
